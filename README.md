# Project Week
 Repository for Robocode

Visit https://www.dropbox.com/request/n3OvDkOPfqlaky4TbYkO to submit your team's robot.

Rules:
1. You may use code from the robots AdvancedRobotExample, LinearTargeting, and BulletDodging as you wish.
2. The other robots are included as opponents for you to test your robot against. You may copy their strategies if you want, but you may not copy their code.
